Chapter 1 - Day 1 
Quest:
Task: Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words
Answer: "To sum it up in a short sentence a blockchain is a database that everybody can use without restrictions. Also it is decentralised meaning that it does not belong to anybody."

Task: Explain what a Smart Contract is.
Answer: "A smart contract is a sort of interface that allows anybody to interact with a blockchain. You can also say its a roolbook. The smart contract will be developed individually for a requirement. You can use it with the given parameters and it will perform an action for instance to update data to a blockchain. ."

Task: Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
Answer: "A contract is more like an object oriented principle with state and class-like behavior, whereas a script could be seen as a set of inline computational instructions."


Chapter 1 - Day 2 - The Flow Blockchain & Cadence

Task: What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
Answer: "They are Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience and Resource Oriented Programming"

Task: In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
Answer: "Well it shows the advantages of Cadance compared with other smart contract languages. The design of these pillars are results of mistakes of other chains and should make it better. And this is usually a good thing. Robust and easy to learn is also a big plus in terms of application and attracting developers to the chain. Like me a former java developer ;)"
