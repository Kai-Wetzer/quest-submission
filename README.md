Chapter 1 - Day 1 
Quest:

Chapter 1 - Day 2 - The Flow Blockchain & Cadence

Task: What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
Answer: "They are Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience and Resource Oriented Programming"

Task: In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
Answer: "Well it shows the advantages of Cadance compared with other smart contract languages. The design of these pillars are results of mistakes of other chains and should make it better. And this is usually a good thing. Robust and easy to learn is also a big plus in terms of application and attracting developers to the chain. Like me a former java developer ;)"
